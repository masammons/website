# Abstract

Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a tumor
suppression mechanism that blocks cell proliferation
in response to oncogenic signaling. OIS is frequently
accompanied by multinucleation; however, the origin
of this is unknown. Here, we show that multinucleate
OIS cells originate mostly from failed mitosis. Prior
to senescence, mutant H-RasV12 activation in primary
human fibroblasts compromised mitosis,
concordant with abnormal expression of mitotic
genes functionally linked to the observed mitotic
spindle and chromatin defects. Simultaneously,
H-RasV12 activation enhanced survival of cells with
damaged mitoses, culminating in extended mitotic
arrest and aberrant exit from mitosis via mitotic slippage.
ERK-dependent transcriptional upregulation
of Mcl1 was, at least in part, responsible for
enhanced survival and slippage of cells with mitotic
defects. Importantly, mitotic slippage and oncogene
signaling cooperatively induced senescence and key
senescence effectors p21 and p16. In summary, activated
Ras coordinately triggers mitotic disruption
and enhanced cell survival to promote formation of
multinucleate senescent cells.
