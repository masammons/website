# Abstract

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that can have devastating health consequences. The developmental and neurological effects of a ZIKV infection arise in part from the virus triggering cellular stress pathways and perturbing transcriptional programs. To date, the underlying mechanisms of transcriptional control directing viral restriction and virus-host interaction are understudied. Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress-induced transcriptional effector that modulates the expression of genes involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including inflammation and antiviral responses, to restore cellular homeostasis. While ATF3 is known to be upregulated during ZIKV infection, the mode by which ATF3 is activated, and the specific role of ATF3 during ZIKV infection is unknown. In this study, we show via inhibitor and RNA interference approaches that ZIKV infection initiates the integrated stress response pathway to activate ATF4 which in turn induces ATF3 expression. Additionally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 system to delete ATF3, we found that ATF3 acts to limit ZIKV gene expression in A549 cells. We also determined that ATF3 enhances the expression of antiviral genes such as STAT1 and other components in the innate immunity pathway to induce an ATF3-dependent anti-ZIKV response. Our study reveals crosstalk between the integrated stress response and innate immune response pathways and highlights an important role for ATF3 in establishing an antiviral effect during ZIKV infection.
