####Undergraduate research in the Sammons lab at UAlbany

Dr. Sammons views undergraduate research as a critical component of your undergraduate science eductation, especially for those of you who are planning on future careers in lab or medical-based research. 

There are **two** methods for joining the Sammons lab as an undergraduate researcher. 

1. As part of an academic course. This includes ABIO399 or ABIO499 for Biology majors and other options if you are a member of another academic department at the University at Albany. 
2. As a *paid* research project assistant. 

*You cannot volunteer to do research in the lab, even just to test it out to see how it goes*

If you have any questions about these policies, please contact [Morgan](mailto:masammons@albany.edu)
