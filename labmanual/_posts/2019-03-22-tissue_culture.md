####Tissue Culture Procedures and Best Practices


* Do not bring any bacteria-related items into the TC room. If you need a swinging bucket centrifuge, use the Molecular Core equipment. 
* Check the vacuum trap before using. If it is greater than 3/4 full, please empty. Add 1/3rd volume of bleach and let sit for 5 minutes before disposing down the drain. Bleach can be found under the sink in the main lab or at the CAS Store (if we are out). 
* We have a **sign up sheet** outside the TC room. Please use it to reserve your time and be considerate of others. If you sign up, use the time!
