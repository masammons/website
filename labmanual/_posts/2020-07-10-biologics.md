##Plasmids
We keep track of our plasmids using Google Sheets, a link to which can be found in the lab Slack "Organization" channel. If you need to be invited to either Slack or the Organization channel, please let [Morgan](/team/morgan-sammons) know and he'll help out. 

When you make a plasmid, add it to the plasmid archive spreadsheet and include all of the information on the document. If there is no information for that particular plasmid (for example, in the Addgene column), put NA.

The first column of the spreadsheet is the Plasmid Identifier number, which is sequentially numbered. When you add something, generate the Plasmid Identifier by looking at what the last number is in the spreadsheet and give your plasmid the next number. It's that easy! (Actually, it's easier, Google Sheets will autogenerate the sequential numbers if you drag down from the previous cell). 

Plasmids will be kept in your own personal archive and stored at -20ËšC for long term storage. Keep a separate box/boxes for your plasmids. This will help everyone now and in the future. 

You **need to** keep track of the contents of this archive such that all lab members can see what reagents we have available. All plasmids **must** be sequence verified before adding to the plasmid archive spreadsheet and (obviously) before they are used in any subsequent experiments. 

####_Snapgene and plasmid maps_
Every plasmid we create, obtain from Addgene, purchase, or get from another lab **must** have an associated [Snapgene](www.snapgene.com) file/plasmid map if practical. If we make it or purchase it, this shouldn't be an issue. You may have to work at it, but it is going to be better for you now and in the future. It'll also help your lab mates and any future lab members who might want that information. The Snapgene [website](www.snapgene.com/resources/plasmid-files/) has a number of common plasmid backbones already annotated and ready to download (things like pcDNA3.1, pgL4.24, pUC18, etc). [Addgene](www.adgene.com) also has Snapgene-style plasmid maps available to download for almost all of their plasmids, meaning it should be very straightforward to modify them to include your changes. 

Make your plasmid maps using Snapgene and annotate as best you can. Snapgene will automatically annotate common features (CMV promoter, primer binding sites, etc) but you should annotate anything that is novel or specific to just that plasmid. Primers used for cloning, PCR, etc should also be added to the plasmid map using Snapgene (and of course should be in the [oligo spreadsheet](/misc/labmanual/ordering)).

After you make your Snapgene/plasmid map, you need to add that file to the repository (found in the *plasmid_repository* folder on Desktop of **_quark_**). 

When adding the Snapgene file to the repository, please rename the file to match the Plasmid Identifier number so future you (or current Morgan) doesn't have to try to decode whatever naming convention you use for yourself.

If the plasmid comes from another group and they send an old map picture or just give you written information about the plasmid, include as much information in the description field as you can that would help us in the future. 

An example would be saying 

> *"open reading frame inserted into the multiple cloning site of pUC18 between the NotI and XbaI restriction sites."*









##Oligos
Almost all of our packages arrive at the Life Sciences Loading Dock and are delivered directly to the lab by Dane Cellupica. When Dane has a day off, packages are normally delivered to the CAS Scientific Store in the Chemistry Building basement. 

That's pretty much it. That's receiving.
