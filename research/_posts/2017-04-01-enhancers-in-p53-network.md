title: Enhancers in the p53 network

We previously discovered that p53 extensively binds to transcriptional regulatory sequences known as enhancers (Sammons et al, 2015).  Enhancers are DNA sequences critical for temporal and spatial control of gene expression. We believe that p53 binding and regulation of enhancers is a fundamental function for p53 across cell types.
