Congratulations are in order for [Dana Woodstock](/team/dana-woodstock/) who successfully defended her dissertation on January 10th, 2025! 

Dana has been with us since mid-2019 and made it through COVID and many other ups and downs (including having [Morgan](/team/morgan-sammons/) as a mentor!). She developed some very interesting tools that we've been using to screen for the activity of transcription factor paralogs and isoforms, an incredibly challenging problem relevant across biological systems. 

We will miss Dana as she goes out into the world to bring all of her UAlbany-derived knowledge to bear on new biological questions.
