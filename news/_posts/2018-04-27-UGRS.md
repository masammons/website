[Sarah](/team/sarah-soliman/) and [Matt](/team/matthew-cacciola) presented posters at the 2018 Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Research Symposium. 

Sarah presented her work on the *Drosophila* p53 network. She demonstrated that functional p53 enhancers from *Drosophila* do not function in human cell lines, even when human p53 can bind. These data suggest additional *trans*-factors are necessary for activity of p53 enhancers.

Matt presented his work on identifying functional human p53 enhancers. He identified three enhancers regulating two human genes (*GDNF* and *GDF15*) that are bound and regulated by p53. Interestingly, *GDF15* is regulated by two enhancers with differential regulation in the abscence of p53.
