We are sad to see Abigail Goldman wrap up her [Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program ](https://www.albany.edu/rna/reu-in-rna) project for the Summer of 2024. Abigail spent this past summer exploring RNA-based tools for identifying genomic regions that regulate transcription. She presented her work at RNA Day (AUG 1) with the other NSF REU students and the Summer Bioinformatics Program Cohort. 

We are so thankful to her for her hard work, and we are positive that she'll have a fantastic career as a biochemist! For now, Abigail will , a rising junior at Drew University, to the Sammons Lab for the summer. Abigail is part of the RNA Institute 

Thanks, as well, to [Gaby](/team/gabriele-baniulyte/) for helping train Abigail in CRISPR methods this summer!
