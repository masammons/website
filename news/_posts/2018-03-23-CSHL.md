##The Sammons Lab traveled to the Cold Spring Harbor meeting Systems Biology: Global Regulation of Gene Expression from March 20th-23rd. 

### [Ally](/team/ally-catizone/) presented her poster on discovering transcription factor and sequence determinants of p53-dependent enhancer activity.

###[Gizem](/team/gizem-karsliuzunbas/) presented her work on the mechanisms that drive differential p53 transcriptional responses across cell types.

###[Morgan](/team/morgan-sammons/) presented the second half of [Gizem's](/team/gizem-karsliuzunbas/) project demonstrating that p63 acts as a true pioneer factor and establishes/maintains epithelial-specific enhancer structure.
