We are excited to welcome Abigail Goldman, a rising junior at Drew University, to the Sammons Lab for the summer. Abigail is part of the RNA Institute [Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program ](https://www.albany.edu/rna/reu-in-rna).

Abigail will be working with [Gaby](/team/gabriele-baniulyte/) on using RNA-based CRISPR inhibition tools to identify genomic regions that might be transcriptional regulatory elements!
