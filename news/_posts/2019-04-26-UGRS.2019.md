Congratulations to [Sylvia](/team/Sylvia-Kuang/) and [Kate](/team/Kate-Sazon/) on their presentations at the University at Albany Undergraduate Research Symposium, hosted by the Department of Biological Sciences. 


Kate presented her poster on evolutionary conservation of enhancer function across metazoa. Sylvia gave a presentation of her Honors Thesis work in the lab, which focused on how p63-bound enhancers function and what genes are under p63-dependent enhancer control.
