We are incredibly grateful to the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences for funding our R35 MIRA (Maximizing Investigators Research Award) grant for the next 5 years. The project investigates key genetic and biochemical features of the transcriptional response to cell stress, with a specific focus on how the stress response is encoded in the genome and epigenome.
