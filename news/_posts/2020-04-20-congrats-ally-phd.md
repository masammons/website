Congratulations are in order for [Ally Catizone](/team/ally-catizone/) who successfully defended her dissertation on April 20th, 2021! 

While in the lab, Ally did foundational work on p53 regulated enhancers which culminated in two recent papers.  [Catizone et al 2019](/papers/catizone-cellcycle/) and [Catizone et al 2020](/papers/catizone-nar/)

Ally is now a support scientist at Genscript!
