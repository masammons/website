A hearty congratulations to [Michael Bratslavsky](/team/michael-bratslavsky) and [Mya Moriconi](/team/mya-moriconi) who just graduated from the University at Albany with degrees in Biological Sciences and Human Biology. We are absolutely thrilled that both Michael and Mya have wrapped up their undergraduate careers, and look forward to their continued success.
