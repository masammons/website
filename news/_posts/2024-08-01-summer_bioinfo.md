We had an incredible group of virtual students for the RNA Institute Summer Bioinformatics program. This is an exciting group of rising senior high school students from around the Capital DistricsEach student spent their summer learning how to perform RNA-seq and differential splicing analysis, use high-performance computing resources, and engaging in professional development opportunities. Shout out to [Gaby](/team/gabriele-baniulyte/) who mentored 7 different students this summer! 

Four of our students were able to join us on campus for RNA Day celebrations, where they presented a poster outlining the work they did this past summer.
