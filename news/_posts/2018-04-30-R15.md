###We are incredibly excited that our 3 year National Institutes of Health [AREA](https://area.nih.gov/) grant has officially been funded!

This award focuses on using genomic approaches to dissect the mechanisms underlying the development and activity of epithelial cell types. Specifically, we're going to figure out how the transcription factor p63 controls epithelial enhancer networks to properly regulate gene expression required for cell identity. 

For an idea of the direction we are going, please see our submission to [bioRxiv](papers/karsliuzunbas-bioRxiv/) where [Gizem](team/gizem-karsliuzunbas), [Faraz](team/faraz-ahmed), and [I](team/morgan-sammons) analyze cell type-dependent p53 and p63 target genes.
