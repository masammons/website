title: Does Excel excel?
author: Morgan Sammons
---

I need to admit this right off the bat: I still use Microsoft Excel to do a significant portion of my data analysis. My trainees do as well. And deep down, I do not think there is nearly the problem with using Excel (or other spreadsheet software alternatives like LibreOffice) that many in the computer science/bioinformatics world might lead you to believe. There is something to be said for simplicity and for being able to actually "see" and interact with your data. 

I would be (more) of a fool if I didn't say there are extreme limitations to Excel that preclude its use on large datasets. 

These include 
1. row *and* column limits

2. severe trouble with sorting lists by any feature other than by numerical values,

3. problems with reproducible workflows, scripting, and data formats, and

4. **most importantly**, automatic formatting that leads to data analysis errors.

These items are summarized incredibly well in a recent [PeerJ Preprint](https://peerj.com/preprints/3183/). 

I think this is an essential read for anyone who uses spreadsheets to collect data (so, most of us!)
