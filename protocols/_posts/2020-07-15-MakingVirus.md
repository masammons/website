​**Supplier**: Polyplus Transfection
​
**Item Number**: 114-15
​
**Storage**: 4C
​
**Storage Location**: 4C fridge in Transfection Reagents Box
​
**Uses**: Creating stable/transient cell lines

**Notes**: ALL STEPS MUST BE DONE IN HOOD USING STERILE TECHNIQUE


**JetPRIME Transfection Kit**

- Day 1
1. Seed cells in a 6-well plate in 2mL of appropriate culture medium. Experiment can be scaled up/down if necessary. 

- Day 2
1. Prepare Transfection master mix by multiplying the following amount of each component by the number of wells you have. 
	**Transfection MM**
	- DNA				1ug
	- psPAX				0.6ug
	- MD2G				0.4ug
	- JetPRIME Buffer	200uL
	- JetPRIME Reagent	4uL
2. Dilute plasmid and viral DNA in appropriate volume of JetPRIME Buffer. Vortex for 5 seconds and spin down briefly.
3. Add appropriate volume of JetPRIME Reagent. Vortex for 10 seconds and spin down briefly.
4. Incubate Transfection MM at room temp. for 10 minutes. 
5. Add 200uL of transfection MM to each well containing cells in media, DROPWISE. USE EXTREME CAUTION AS TO NOT DISTURB SEEDED CELlS.
6. Gently rock plates back and forth, side to side. Incubate plates at 37C for at least 24hours.  

- Day 3
1. Remove supernatant from each well and add to a labeled 15mL conical tube. If multiple wells per virus, supernatant can be pooled. Store pooled virus at 4C until 48 hour sample is collected.
2. Using EXTREME CAUTION - add 2mL of media back to each well. Incubate at 37 for another 24 hours to obtain a 48hour sample.

- Day 4
1. Remove supernatant to each well and add to the labeled 24hour samples. 
2. Filter each pooled sample using a .45uM sterile filter into a new labeled 15mL conical tube. 
3. Aliquot 500uL-1mL of sterile-filtered virus into labeled 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes. Store aliquots at -80C.
