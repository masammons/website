​**Supplier**: GenScript
​
**Item Number**: M00653
​
**Storage**:4C
​
**Storage Location**: 4C Fridge
​
**Uses**: Running proteins on a gel for Western Blot

**Notes**: THESE GELS REQUIRE AN ADAPTOR FOR USE IN OUR GEL APPARATUSES - USE MOPS BUFFER!


**SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis**

1. Add 35-50ug of protein per sample, ensuring same amount of protein is added across samples, to a 1.5mL  microcentrifuge tube. 
2. Add Western loading dye at 1x concentration to each sample, pipet up/down to mix. 
3. Incubate samples at 95C for 10 minutes. 
4. Prepare gel apparatus by first removing sticker from bottom of gel and placing inside apparatus. If only one gel is being run, you will need to add the adaptor for the other side. 
5. Additionally, these gels require an adaptor piece to fit properly. Place gel in adaptor and place inside gel apparatus. Lock in place and ensure a tight seal.
6. Add approximately 500mL of MOPS running buffer, ensuring the wells of the gel are covered. 
7. Load samples and include 8uL of a protein ladder on your gel. 
8. Run gel at 140v until dye front reaches the end of the gel. For small proteins, take care as to not let the proteins run off the gel.
