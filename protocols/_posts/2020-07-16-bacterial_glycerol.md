**Purpose**

Bacterial glycerol stocks are the prokaryotic equivalent of cryopreserving mammalian cell lines. The idea is to catalog, preserve, and eventually recover bacteria containing a plasmid of interest. Bacterial glycerol stocks have no effective expiration date (assuming they never thaw) and can save you a day or more when trying to propagate a plasmid. 

**Theory**

A logarithmic culture of bacteria is mixed with an anti-icing agent (in this case glycerol) and frozen to -80˚C, where it is then stored indefinitely. Bacteria (and their plasmids) can be recovered by scraping a small portion of the frozen stock to an LB agar plate or to liquid LB. This would presumbaly save you time compared to having to retransform a plasmid. 

**Method**

1. Start with a fresh, overnight liquid LB culture of a bacterial strain with a sequence verified plasmid. _Do not do this for colonies from overnight ligations or that have not yet been sequence verified._
2. Add 500uL of culture to a 2mL screw cap tube containing 500uL of 50% glycerol (for an effective final concentration of 25% glycerol). 
3. Briefly vortex the tube for 5 seconds to fully mix the tube.
4. Label the tube with a cryolabel on the side, describing as fully as possible the contents of the tube. 
5. Label the top of the tube with relevant information. _Writing on the tube or affixing a label after the tube is frozen won't work!_
6. Place this tube in your bacterial glycerol stock box at -80˚C
7. Keep a record of your stock in a spreadsheet, similar to what you'd do for mammalian cell cryostorage. 

**Making 2mL tubes with sterile 50% glycerol**

1. Take a white cryostorage box and fill with 2mL screwcap tubes (in drawer in main lab below the microcentrifuges). 
2. Make a 50% glycerol stock solution by pouring approximately 25mL of 100% glycerol into a 50mL conical tube. 
3. Microwave this tube for 10 seconds to reduce the viscosity of the glycerol. 
4. While still warm (and easy to pipette), transfer a known amount of 100% glycerol to a new conical tube. 
5. Adjust concentration to 50% glycerol using distilled water. 
6. Sterile filter using a 0.2uM syringe filter into a sterile conical vial (for volumes under 50mL total). 
7. Aliquot 500uL of sterile 50% glycerol into a screwcap tube and close the lid.
