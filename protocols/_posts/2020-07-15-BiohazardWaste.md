**Biohazard Waste Removal**

1. When biohazard trash is full - first tape closed the red trash bag inside. 

2. Close box and tape shut with shipping tape. This box now goes downstairs to the loading dock. 

3. Kindly grab the attention of DANE and ask him to let you into the trash room. This is around the other side of Dane's office (Turn left at the Core entrance -halfway down hall on left).

4. There Dane will take the full biohazard boxes. MAKE SURE TO GET NEW BOXES!!!!

5. Fold bottom flaps of box and secure with shipping tape. Add a RED BIOHAZARD BAG from underneath the RIGHT LAB SINK.
