**Gel Electrophoresis**

**NOTES**: Gel electrophoresis is performed on the gel bench in the designated Ethidium bromide area to prevent cross-contamination. 

1. Add 100mL of 1x TAE buffer into a dedicated flask labeled "ETHIDIUM BROMIDE AGAROSE GELS" found in the chemical hood. 
2. Weigh out 1g of Agarose and add to the flask. This will give you a 1% gel - agarose concentrations can be modulated to fit a particular experiment.
3. Microwave solution in 30 second increments to avoid boiling over. Solution is ready when agarose is fully dissolved and solution looks clear and colorless.
4. Allow solution to cool until gloved hand can rest on the bottom of the flask comfortably for <5 seconds.
5. Add Ethidium bromide to cooled solution. 100mL of agarose solution gets 5uL of EtBr. Swirl to mix thoroughly.
6. Place gel cast into apparatus and ensure a quality seal. Place gel comb into empty cast.
7. Pour solution carefully into the gel cast, avoiding bubbles. Allow to solidify, approx. 10-15minutes or until opaque and firm.
8. Remove gel comb and carefully remove gel cast from the apparatus, turning 90 degrees and placing inside gel apparatus so that the open ends of the gel cast are facing towards the electrodes.
9. Add enough 1X TAE buffer to cover the wells of the gel, and load all samples including a DNA Standard Ladder (100bp or 1kB).
10. Once all samples are loaded, cover apparatus by sliding the top into the positive and negative electrodes. 
11. Run the gel at 120v until dye front has reached at least halfway down the gel. Once finished - press STOP, remove cover, and retrieve gel which can now be analyzed using the BioRad Gel Imager downstairs in the Mol. Core.
