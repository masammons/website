**Supplier**: Polyplus Transfection 
​
**Item Number**: jetPRIME Buffer 712-60			jetPRIME Transfection Reagent 114-15
​
**Storage**: 4 degree celsius
​
**Storage Location**: 4 degree common reagents fridge, top shelf, transfection box
​
**Uses**: Transient Transfection, Making Virus
​
**Protocols**: 
Transient Transfection:
			   1. Cell Seeding. Thaw HCTs and culture in Mccoy’s Media (Seed 500,000 cells per well in a 6-well plate in 2 mL Media)

		   	   2. DNA Transfection. Mastermix should contain the following per well for each virus:
							2 ug of desired plasmid 
							200 uL of JetPRIME Buffer 
							4 uL of JetPRIME Reagent
			  	  To prepare Master mix:
							Dilute plasmid DNA in 200 uL of JetPRIME Buffer 
							Vortex for 5 seconds & spin down briefly 
							Add 4 uL of JetPRIME Reagent
							Vortex for 10 seconds & Spin down briefly
							Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes 
							Add 200 uL of transfection mastermix per well, very gently, dropwise.
							Gently rock plates back and forth, side to side. 
							Incubate at 37°C for at least 24 hrs 
		       3.Harvesting
							Aspirate the media from meach well
							Add 500 uL of Trypsin and incubate for 2-5 minutes
							Add 1 mL of Media to resuspend the cells
							Transfer to clean, labeled, 1.5 microfuge tubes
							Pellet the cells (900 rpm for 5 minutes) 
							Aspirate the media 
							Resuspend in 1 mL cold PBS
							Pellet the cells (900 rpm for 5 minutes)
							Repeat the Wash Steps 
							Aspirate the PBS, leaving the pellet
							Wrap and in paper towel and store at -80℃ 

Making Virus:
			  1. Cell Seeding. Thaw 293FTs and culture in DMEM (Seed about 800,000 cells per well in 2 mL of DMEM).
			  2. DNA Transfection. Master mix should contain the following per well for each virus:
			  				2 ug of desired plasmid 
							200 uL of JetPRIME Buffer 
							4 uL of JetPRIME Reagent
				 To prepare Master mix:
							Dilute plasmid DNA in 200 uL of JetPRIME Buffer 
							Vortex for 5 seconds & spin down briefly 
							Add 4 uL of JetPRIME Reagent
							Vortex for 10 seconds & Spin down briefly
							Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes 
							Add 200 uL of transfection mastermix per well, very gently, dropwise.
							Gently rock plates back and forth, side to side. 
							Incubate at 37°C for at least 24 hrs 
			 3. 24 Hour Sample
							Remove the supernatant from each well and transfer it to a labeled 15 mL conical tube. If there are multiple wells per virus, the supernatant can be pooled. 
							Very carefully, add 2 mL of media to each well, using extreme caution not to disrupt the seeded cells.
							Return the cells to the incubator and store the samples at 4℃. 
			 4. 48 Hour Sample
							Remove the supernatant from each well and add it to the labeled 24 hour samples. 
							Filter each pooled sample using a .45 uM sterile filter , into a new clean 15 mL conical tube. 
							Add 8 ug/ul of polybrene and briefly vortex.
							Aliquot the filtered supernatant by 1ML or 500 mL into clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. 
							Store the sample at -80℃.
