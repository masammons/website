**Supplier**: Millipore Sigma
​
**Item Number**: TR-1003G
​
**Storage**: -20 degrees Celsius 
​
**Storage Location**: -20 degree common reagents freezer
​
**Uses**: Making Virus
​
**Notes**: Aliquot at 2- 4 mg/mL and store in the -20 degree freezer. 

**Protocol**:  Making Virus:
			  1. Cell Seeding. Thaw 293FTs and culture in DMEM (Seed about 800,000 cells per well in 2 mL of DMEM).
			  2. DNA Transfection. Master mix should contain the following per well for each virus:
			  				2 ug of desired plasmid 
							200 uL of JetPRIME Buffer 
							4 uL of JetPRIME Reagent
				 To prepare Master mix:
							Dilute plasmid DNA in 200 uL of JetPRIME Buffer 
							Vortex for 5 seconds & spin down briefly 
							Add 4 uL of JetPRIME Reagent
							Vortex for 10 seconds & Spin down briefly
							Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes 
							Add 200 uL of transfection mastermix per well, very gently, dropwise.
							Gently rock plates back and forth, side to side. 
							Incubate at 37°C for at least 24 hrs 
			 3. 24 Hour Sample
							Remove the supernatant from each well and transfer it to a labeled 15 mL conical tube. If there are multiple wells per virus, the supernatant can be pooled. 
							Very carefully, add 2 mL of media to each well, using extreme caution not to disrupt the seeded cells.
							Return the cells to the incubator and store the samples at 4℃. 
			 4. 48 Hour Sample
							Remove the supernatant from each well and add it to the labeled 24 hour samples. 
							Filter each pooled sample using a .45 uM sterile filter , into a new clean 15 mL conical tube. 
							Add 8 ug/ul of polybrene and briefly vortex.
							Aliquot the filtered supernatant by 1ML or 500 mL into clean 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. 
							Store the sample at -80℃.
