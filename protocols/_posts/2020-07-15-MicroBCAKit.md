**Item Number**: 23250
​
**Storage**: Room Temp

**Uses**: Obtaining concentrations of protein lysates for Western Blotting

**Notes**: Albumin ampules can be opened and transferred to a labeled 1.5mL microcentrifuge tube for future personal use. 


**BCA Protein Assay Kit**

1. In a 96 well plate, create a dilution series of 8 standards using the 2mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin ampule/personal aliquot from kit. 
	**Standard Curve Dilution Series**
	- STD (ug)	BSA (uL)	RIPA Buffer (uL)
		0			0			6
		1			0.5			5.5
		2			1			5
		4			2			4
		6			3			3
		8			4			2
		10			5			1
		12			6			0
2. Load 3uL of your sample into labeled wells. (You can do 1uL in triplicate if you'd like technical replicates).
3. Prepare a working reagent master mix by multiplying the number of samples and standards by 100uL. This is the total volume of working reagent you will need. 
4. Add reagent A and B to a tube in a ratio of 50:1, Reagent A:B, with a final volume of the above calculation. 
	-For example: If you have 8 standards and 3 samples, your working reagent volume is 1100uL. Therefore you would add 1078uL of Reagent A to 22uL of Reagent B.
5. Add 100uL of working reagent MM to each well containing sample or standard.
6. Incubate plate at 37C for 30 minutes. 
7. Bring plate downstairs to Sequencing Core and measure absorbance on plate reader at 562nm. Save the excel file and export to your USB flashdrive.
8. Generate a standard curve from your dilution series by plotting concentration of BSA (ug) vs Absorbance. 
9. Using the equation from your standard curve, calculate the concentration per uL for unknown samples.
	- For example, if you added 3uL of sample to a well, divide the value by 3 to get ug/uL.
