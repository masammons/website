​
**Protocol**: CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay:
	Reagent Preparation
			Thaw CellTiter-Blue® Reagent and bring to ambient temperature. A 37°C water bath may be used to thaw the reagent. Protect the CellTiter-Blue® Reagent from direct light.
	Recommended Controls
			No-Cell Control: Set up triplicate wells without cells to serve as the negative control to determine background fluorescence that may be present.
			Untreated Cells Control: Set up triplicate wells with untreated cells to serve as a vehicle control. Add the same solvent used to deliver the test compounds to the vehicle control wells.
			Optional Test Compound Control: Set up triplicate wells without cells containing the vehicle and test compound to test for possible interference with the CellTiter-Blue® Reagent chemistry.
			Positive Control for Cytotoxicity: Set up triplicate wells containing cells treated with a compound known to be toxic to the cells used in your model system.
	Cytotoxicity Assay Protocol
			1. Set up 96-well assay plates containing cells in culture medium. Note: For 384-well plates, the recommended culture volume is 25µl per well. Add 5µl per well of CellTiterBlue® Reagent.
			2. Add test compounds and vehicle controls to appropriate wells so the fi nal volume is 100µl in each well.
			3. Culture cells for the desired test exposure period.
			4. Remove assay plates from 37°C incubator and add 20µl/well of CellTiter-Blue® Reagent.
			5. Shake for 10 seconds.
			6. Incubate using standard cell culture conditions for 1–4 hours. Note: Extended incubation periods may be used for some applications.
			7. Shake plate for 10 seconds and record fluorescence at 560/590nm. 
	Calculation of Results
		Fluorescence Data
			1. Optional: Subtract the average of fluorescence values of the culture medium background from all fluorescence values of experimental wells. Note: Fluorescence can be stopped and stabilized.
			2. Plot fluorescence versus concentration of test compound.
		Absorbance Data
			1. Subtract the average of absorbance 600nm values of the culture medium background from all absorbance 570nm values of experimental wells.
			2. Plot 570–600nm absorbance versus concentration of test compound.
