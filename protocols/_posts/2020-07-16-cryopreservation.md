**Protocol**

1. Cells should be in their growth phase when you begin the cryopreservation procedure. Something in the order of 70-80% confluent is best. 
2. It is best to pre-label your cryovials before starting the procedure. Everything should be done fairly rapidly and labeling can take awhile. 
2. Remove growth media, wash 1X with PBS, and add an appropriate amount of Trypsin. 
3. Once detached from the plate, add an appropriate amount of growth media (2 volumes of media to 1 volume of trypsin) and count the number of cells using the Countess.
4. Spin down at 400 x G for 5 minutes and resuspend cells in the appropriate amount of Cryopreservation media to put your cells at 5e6 cells/mL (that's 5,000,000 cells per mL)
5. Aliquot 1mL of cell suspension into a screw cap cryovial and close the cap. 
6. Place tubes in the controlled temperature cryo unit and place in the -80ËšC freezer overnight. 
7. In the morning, transfer your tubes to liquid nitrogen storage.
8. Place the controlled freezing unit back in the tissue culture room. 
8. Be sure to add the new cells to your [Cryostorage spreadsheet](/labmanual/biologics)

**Important Considerations**

Label your cryovials with as much information as you can. Cell name, any modifications to the cell (viral transduction, knockout/knockdown), drug resistance, date of freezing, passage #, etc. 

It is also best to use the little cryovial inserts, which can be labeled as well. When you go to take them out of the liquid nitrogen, having some identifier on the cap is helpful. Combined with a rigorous and accurate accounting on the cryostorage spreadsheet, labeling the caps will allow you to recover.  your cell line of interest very rapidly.
