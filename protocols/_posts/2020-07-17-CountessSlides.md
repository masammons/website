**Supplier**: Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific
​
**Item Number**: 100078809
​
**Storage**: Room temperature
​
**Storage Location**: Main lab, Tissue Culture room, drawer under the paper towels 
​
**Uses**: Count cells/ml during cell culture
​

**Protocol**

1. Add 2mL (if in a 10cm plate) Trypsin to cells and place in the incubator until cells detach from the plate. 

2. When cells detach from the plate, add 4mL (twice the amount) of media and transfer the cells:media to a 15 mL conical tube. 

3. Pipet up and down to make sure cells are resuspended. 

4. Take 50 uL of cell suspension and add it to a 1.5mL Microfuge tube. 

5. Add 50uL of Trypan Blue to the 1.5mL Microfuge tube with your cells and pipet up and down to mix. 

6. Take 10uL of your cell:media:trypan blue mix and transfer it to a cell counting chamber slide by holding the pipet at a 45 degree angle to ensure that is goes in the chamber. 

7. Place the slide in the countess until you hear a click. 

9. When the cell appear as clear as possible on the screen click "capture". 

10. The number of live cells that appears on the top, right is the number of cells/mL. 

11. To determine the volume of cell suspension needed to seed a certain number of cells, divide the number of cells you want by the cells/mL. 

12. Seed the number of cells in the plate with the desired amount of media.
