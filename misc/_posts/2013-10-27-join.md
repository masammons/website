The lab is now close to capacity, but we're still taking applications from qualified graduate student applicants.  We place particular emphasis on molecular biology and genomics skills. Lab members have spanned biologists, statisticians, physicists and computer scientists, women and men, high school students through postdocs. We are committed to improving diversity in the computational sciences. Applicants of diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.

## Graduate students

Graduate students from the [MCDN program] at the [State University of New York at Albany] can join the group.  Rotation students are welcome.
