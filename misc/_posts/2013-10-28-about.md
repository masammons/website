## Credit

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. This website design is indebted to the [Bedford Lab](http://www.bedford.io) at [Fred Hutch](http://www.fredhutch.org) and [Premal Shah](http://www.theshahlab.org) at [Rutgers](http://genetics.rutgers.edu). Besides designing great websites, Trevor and Premal do some great science, too. Check them out.
