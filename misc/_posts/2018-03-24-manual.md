# Welcome to the [Sammons Lab](http://www.sammonslab.org)

>We are members of the [Department of Biological Sciences](http://www.albany.edu/biology) and are located in the Life Sciences Research Building on the Uptown Campus of the [State University of New York at Albany](http://www.albany.edu)

Style Guide for Figures

Writing Manuscripts

**Organizing Raw Data (non-sequencing)**  
backups, etc
folder with main project
subfolders with year
subfolder with month
subfolder with project tag

**Organizing References Using Zotero**  
We use [Zotero](www.zotero.org) to organize manuscript references and add these references to our manuscripts, grants, and other lab documents. Zotero has a stand-alone app, a web browser extension, and a plug-in for Microsoft Word and Google Docs. 


**Data and Visualization Standards**  
Prism  

**Illustrator**
	8.5x11 in to start
	Label Text: Arial, 10pt (can bold)
	Figure Label Text: Arial, 12pt bold
	Bar graphs only for single point datasets
	To show bio replicates, show individual points with median
	Boxplots show individual points with median
	Stattistics (single boxplot comparisons, multiple comparisons, etc)



**Lab Code of Conduct**  


**Organizing Plasmids, Primers, and Other Wetlab Items**

plasmid maps with snapgene
store in -20 with grid chart/documentation
expand in excel

Primers in excel on ordering sheet
Antibody List (-20 and 4C)



**Protocols**  
RT-qPCR
competent bacteria
LB amp
qPCR for libraries
ChIPseq
RNAseq
Library Prep
MPRA Library creation (electroporation)



**Computational Tools**  
conda
GitHub


**Accessing the RIT Resources**
