The *p53motifDB* is a repository of information about potential genomic binding sites for the transcription factor p53. In addition to identifying potential candidate genomic locations in the hg38 human reference genome, we also provide additional information about the local genomic context. These data include genomic and epigenomic information alongside regulatory and functional annotations. 

Users can access the dataset via web-accessible Shiny App or in multiple downloadable formats via our Zenodo repository.

# FAQ

#### How do I use the [p53motifDB Shiny App](www.shinyapp.com) 

> First, here is a link to the 

#### Can you tell me where you downloaded all the raw data that were used to create the p53motifDB?
> Sure! Links to all of the data sources for the p53motifDB can be found on our [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org) repository or or can be downloaded [here](/images/p53motifdb/Table_1_DataSources.xlsx).  

#### I want to use structured query language to explore the p53motifDB. What can I do?
> You can download a pre-compiled sqlite database OR compile your own database in another format from the processed data tables found on our [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org) repository. 
> 
> We've also provided the scripts we used to generate our sqlite database (via *R*). 

#### What are these data tables?
> There are two types of data tables. 
> 
> First, we have the "primary" table, which contains all biographical information about each p53
> motif identified in the hg38 human reference genome. The most important information is the "unique_id" which contains the genomic coordinate for each p53 motif, but also acts as a unique identifier that can be used to query accessory tables (described below). 
> 
> We also have "accessory tables" that contain extra qualitative or quantitative information that could not be captured in the primary table. This includes more in-depth data relating to specific biographical information from the primary table. Each accessory table also contains a primary key that can be used for building a standard sql-style database. 

#### OK, but what is in each data table?
>  Information about the contents and type of each data table can be found found in our [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org) repository or can be downloaded [here](/images/p53motifdb/Schema_p53motifDB.xlsx)
