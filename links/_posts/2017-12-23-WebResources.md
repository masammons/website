Links I really like

[UCSC Genome Browser](http://www.genome.ucsc.edu)
: Ubiquitous and fantastically data rich, UCSC Genome Browser is my go-to.

[WashU Epigenome Browswer](http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/)
: Excellent 3D visualization tools as well as host to a number of consortium data hubs

[Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle)
: Search for your favorite genes and compare expression across multiple cancer cell lines. Very well done.

[HOMER](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/)
: One of the best annotated software suites, this is still my favorite semi-integrated next-gen sequencing analysis software. Bonus for being great at its original function: DNA motif analysis

[Bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
: Indispensable tool for analysis of genomic intervals/peak locations. 

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
: Easiest way to install and update command line software tools on Mac.

[Homebrew Formulas](http://formulae.brew.sh/)
: Nice list of software that can be installed/managed by homebrew.

[Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
: NIH-funded repository for genomics data of all types

[Sequence Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
: NIH-funded repository for next-generation sequencing reads.

[deeptools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
: Very nice suite of tools for some ChIP-seq/RNA-seq applications; many uses!

[DEseq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)

[STAR Aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
: Super fast and accurate aligner: requires high RAM for mammalian genomes, but speed can't be beat.

[Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)
: My favorite short read aligner (mainly because I know how to use it). 

[HOCOMOCO](http://hocomoco11.autosome.ru/)
: Nice database of DNA-binding protein motifs

[Firebrowse](http://firebrowse.org/)
: Integration of (primarily) the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data

[cBioPortal](http://www.cbioportal.org/)
: Integration of TCGA and many other datasets

[EMBOSS](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/)
: Software suite that performs numerous DNA/RNA sequence manipulations

[JASPAR](http://jaspar.genereg.net/)
: Transcription factor binding motif database

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
: Learn how to code (I need to do this)
