Serene earned her bachelors degree at Bay Path University and defended her PhD dissertation in the Summer of 2022 in the [MCDN Program](http://www.albany.edu/biology/graduate_programs/doctoral/mcdn/main.shtml). 

She was awarded an RNA Institute Fellowship for the 2018-2019 academic year. 

Serene studies how multiple parallel stress response pathways converge and diverge at the level of transcription.  


**Fun Fact**: Serene is an identical twin, which allows her to do 2X the amount of work as a normal graduate student.
