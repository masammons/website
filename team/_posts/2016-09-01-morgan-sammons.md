I'm an Assistant Professor at [State University of New York at Albany](http://www.albany.edu) in the [Department of Biology](http://www.albany.edu/biology). I study the role of chromatin structure on gene expression using the p53 family as a model.  How does chromatin regulate transcriptional output? How does p53 binding at enhancers control downstream transcription? Do other transcription factors regulate chromatin structure and enhancer activity to support or inhibit p53 tumor suppression?
