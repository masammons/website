I'm an Assistant Professor at [State University of New York at Albany](http://www.albany.edu) in the [Department of Biology](http://www.albany.edu/biology). I teach the undergraduate courses ABIO 329: Genetics of Human Disease and UFSP 102: Freshman Seminar. I also co-teach  the graduate course ABIO 524: Advanced Molecular Biology which is a core course in our Biology PhD Program.

I also run a research lab. We study the [p53 family of transcription factors](/research/p53-family/). This paralogous family controls a number of critical organismal behaviors, including tumor suppression, epithelial differentiation, and control of cilia production. We are interested in how seemingly similar proteins generate incredibly diverse transcriptional and cellular outcomes. 

My academic career started at the [University of Toledo](http://www.utoledo.edu) in the Department of Biological Sciences. I performed undergraduate research in the lab of [Dr. Brian Ashburner](http://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/bio/research/ashburner.html). Brian is now the Associate Dean for Graduate Affairs in the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. 

I then pursued my PhD at [Vanderbilt University] where I worked with [Dr. Andrew Link](https://wag.app.vanderbilt.edu/PublicPage/Faculty/Details/26885). I graduated in 2010. 

My postdoctoral work was performed under the mentorship of [Dr. Shelley Berger](http://hosting.med.upenn.edu/berger/) at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Berger runs the Epigenetics Institue in the Perelman School of Medicine at Penn.
