I'm an Assistant Professor at [State University of New York at Albany](http://www.albany.edu) in the [Department of Biology](http://www.albany.edu/biology). I study the dynamics of virus populations.  How do strains spread through the world?  How do strains evolve in response to immune pressure?  And ultimately, what makes a strain successful?

I received my bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago and my PhD from Harvard University, advised by [Dan Hartl](http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/hartl/lab/DanielHartl.html).  Following my PhD I worked for Wolfram Research on [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/), worked on infectious disease dynamics at the University of Michigan with [Mercedes Pascual](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/directory/faculty/pascual/) and worked on viral phylogenetics with [Andrew Rambaut](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/people/arambaut/) at the University of Edinburgh.
