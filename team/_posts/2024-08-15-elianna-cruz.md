From Elianna: 

I graduated from Rowan University with a B.S. in Biological Science and Neuroscience minor. During my undergraduate years I worked as a laboratory assistant and resident assistant. Currently I attend the University at Albany, where I’m studying to achieve a Master’s degree in Biology with a Molecular, Cellular, Developmental, and Neurobiology (MCDN) concentration.   My research interests mainly align with genomics and epigenetics, but I am open to study under different topics to further increase my knowledge. I work and study under the co-mentoring of [Dr. Cara Pager](https://www.pagerlab.com/lab-members) and [Dr. Morgan Sammons](http://thesammonslab.org/team/morgan-sammons/).
