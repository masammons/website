Sarah was an undergraduate research student from 2016 to May of 2018 when she graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biology from the Department of Biological Sciences here at the [University at Albany](www.albany.edu). 

Sarah undertook a project in a novel area for the Sammons lab. She investigated the requirement for local co-factors at p53-dependent enhancers by making cross-species comparisons of enhancer function. Sarah took the canonical _Drosophila_ p53 enhancer regulating the _rpr_ gene and asked whether it was functional in mammalian systems. Previous work suggested that this enhancer, which contains a functional p53 response element motif, should be p53-responsive in human cell lines. She found that it wasn't, and that this was likely due to a lack of conserved transcription factor motifs within the _rpr_ enhancer.  

Sarah presented her work at the [2018 Biology Undergraduate Research Symposium](news/UGRS/).
