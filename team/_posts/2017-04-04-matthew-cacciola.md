Matt was an undergraduate research student from 2016 to May of 2018 when he graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the Department of Biological Sciences here at the [University at Albany](www.albany.edu). 

He made some early contributions to understanding p53 enhancer function, specifically whether enhancers in the p53 network have p53-independent activities or if they are solely used for stress-dependent regulatory control. He presented his work at the [2018 Biology Undergraduate Research Symposium](news/UGRS/).
